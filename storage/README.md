Windows accumulates **temporary files, large unused data, and fragmented storage**, leading to low disk space and slow performance. These scripts help **clean up, optimize, and manage storage efficiently**.

## 🛑 Common Problems:
- Running out of disk space due to junk files  
- Large files consuming unnecessary storage  
- Fragmented drives reducing system performance
